A Cloud Data Center consists of the number of server clusters connected with various kinds of clients by a wired and or wireless network. A cloud data service is a remote version of a data centre located somewhere away from your company's physical premises that let you access your data through the internet. In this study, the general two-stage-task scheduling problem was dealt with by establishing a general model for two-stage-task scheduling for a CloudData Center based on the process of task allocation. CDCs are a resource pool that provides users with all kinds of cloud services.
Clients even do not need an OS or any application programs and may either have a very small amount of local storage or none at all. Since OSes and application programs themselves stored on CDCs or the relative data execution results can be streamed to clients over a network, huge amounts of data need to be transferred in real-time. How the data transfer is managed and scheduled directly affects the performance of the whole system. Tasks and requests from clients have to be allocated to available machines, and the order in which tasks are processed on each machine has to be arranged, with the overall goal of minimizing the makespan.
In a cloud environment, task scheduling is a very important issue. It is used to schedule tasks for better utilization of resources by allocating certain tasks to particular resources at a particular time.

In this study, the general two-stage-task scheduling problem was dealt with by establishing a general model for two-stage-task scheduling for a CDC based on the process of task allocation. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows.
We study how the task scheduling problem in data centers of cloud computing can be conducted as a two-stage flow shop scheduling problem with [mð1Þ 2], [mð2Þ 2], and establish a mathematical model of task scheduling with the goal of minimizing the makespan.
We show that the Johnson’s rule can be well combined with the GA for the two-stage flow shop scheduling problem, and present a Johnson’s-rule-based GA (JRGA) algorithm to solve it. More specifically, the GA was used to allocate tasks to appropriate machines, and the Johnson’s rule was used as a decoding technique to determine the order in which tasks are processed on each machine.
We study how to improve the original GA to make it more suitable for the nature of this scheduling problem, and design new crossover and mutation operations to increase the fitness of individuals in JRGA. We finally compare the JRGA with the conventional LS algorithm and the improved LS (ILS) algorithm by experimental results, and prove that the JRGA is able to converge to the global optimum.
We also classify the existing studies concerning the two stage task scheduling problem depending on the number of machines used in each of the two stages, and show that the JRGA can be used not only in the data centers of cloud computing but also in the others domains that are of the special.
At the point when a
customer needs an OS or a program, it sends an assistance demand to the worker groups, which at that point stream the proper programming to the customer over the organization. Every worker group may utilize a circulated stockpiling methodology, like Hadoop, or
viewed as one machine. There are normally various customers making a large number of solicitations and an incredible number of worker bunches. Errands and customer solicitations ought to be dispensed to accessible machines, and the request for the undertakings on each machine ought to be orchestrated, in order to limit the absolute fulfillment time, which is known as the makespan. This investigation thought about the issue of how to plan information demand undertakings on the machines in a CDC framework. An undertaking is expected to comprise of two stages: task executing and results transmission (i.e., executing and transmission). Executing mplies getting information from a plate or dispersed stockpiling framework, putting away it in memory and finishing execution; and transmission implies communicating the execution results from
memory to a customer over the organization.
Since the executing furthermore, transmission times rely upon the size of the undertaking, it is a two-stage-task booking issue that is to advance handling of a bunch of assignments in two interaction stages (I =1, 2), each of which has different processors or machines 1⁄2mðiþ 1; ði 1⁄4 1; 2þ
working in equal. The nitty gritty depictions and characterizations of the two-stage-task planning issue can be found in the following segment. Much of the time two-stage planning
issues are NP-finished [4]. One significant and troublesome issue is the manner by which to limit the makespan when twostage errands are booked on a multiprocessor framework.
